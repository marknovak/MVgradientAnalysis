Permutation-based multivariate approach to gradient analysis

R code to implement a permutation-based multivariate approach to gradient analysis for inferring the relative importance of putative drivers of matrix nestedness.  (Previous univariate methods of gradient analysis assume that explanatory variables are uncorrelated.)  In the paper we used a structural equation model (path analysis) to disentangle the direct and indirect influences of the row- and column-specific variables (since many variables were causally dependent), but multiple regression can also be used if no indirect effects are suspected.
